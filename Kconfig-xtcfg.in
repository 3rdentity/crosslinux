config XBT_NAME
	string
	default ""
	prompt "Cross-tool Chain Name Prefix (Tuple)"
	---help---
	  Enter the cross-tool chain name prefix (tuple) here.

	  Cross-tool chain components such as gcc are called by prefixing the
	  target tuple to the component name e.g,
	  "armv7-generic-linux-gnueabi-gcc", wherein
	  "armv7-generic-linux-gnueabi" is the tuple and "gcc" is the component.

	  Some cross-tool chains have shortened names and may not use the tuple
	  name, such as "armv7-gcc" or "ppc-gcc".

	  If you enter "fubar" here, then the cross-tool chain will be called
	  with program names like "fubar-gcc" and "fubar-as", etc.

	  ***** NOTICE do NOT put a "-" on the end of the name; do NOT enter
		something like "fubar-".
