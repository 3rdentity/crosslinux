	  Select this option to cross-build the ncurses libraries.

	  Regardless of this option and the ncurses libraries, these ncurses
	  terminfo files will be built, by a host-built program called tic, for
	  the target system (target system path are shown).

	---help---
	  Select this option to cross-build the ncurses libraries with wide
	  character support.  The wide-character libraries are usable in
	  multibyte and traditional 8-bit locales; the normal libraries work
	  properly only in 8-bit locales.  Wide-character and normal libraries
	  are source-compatible, but not binary-compatible.
