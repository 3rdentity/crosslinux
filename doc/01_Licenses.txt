integ Directory
---------------

The integ directory contains configuration files and patches to other projects;
these configuration files and patches each are licensed under a license(es) as
directed by the other projects' license information.

The integ directory contains configuration files and build scripts that are
extensions of the crosslinux configuration files and build scripts, and each
are license according to the following descriptions in this document.

Package Patches
---------------

There are patches in various "patch" directories in the various directories IN
the pkg-cfg/ directory i.e., pkg-cfg/*/patch; in the top-level crosslinux
directory you can find the with an 'ls -d pkg-cfg/*/patch' command.

These directories contain patch(es) that change some part of a software
package.  These patches each are licensed under the same license as the
upstream software package to which they apply.

End Product
-----------

This crosslinux build-tool make a bootable Linux system; this bootable Linux
system is the End Product referenced in this section of this document.

If you deliver, either as sold or given-away, or otherwise publish a crosslinux
build-tool End Product, you must treat the crosslinux build-tool used therein
as being part of the sources needed to rebuild the End Product.  See the file
doc/COPYING, section 3.  This also PARTLY applies to any patches and extensions
to the crosslinux build-tool itself, ONLY with the following exceptions:

=> the build scripts in the site/ directory that are directly invoked by the
   cl-bt makefile; these are explicitly named herein:
        site/bld-bootfs-0.sh   site/bld-clean-1.sh   site/bld-pkgs-0.sh
        site/bld-bootfs-1.sh   site/bld-kernel-0.sh  site/bld-pkgs-1.sh
        site/bld-bootimg-0.sh  site/bld-kernel-1.sh  site/bld-rootfs-0.sh
        site/bld-bootimg-1.sh  site/bld-loader-0.sh  site/bld-rootfs-1.sh
        site/bld-clean-0.sh    site/bld-loader-1.sh

=> files in the following directories:
        site/doc/
        site/doc-root/

        ==================================================

1. crosslinux build-tool makefiles and shell scripts

These are all the files used to _build_ a crosslinux system that are developed
by the crosslinux project; these are not the files that are delivered with a
bootable crosslinux-developed system such as CD-ROM image or other tar-file.
These files include, but are not limited to:

=> Makefile.in, cl-bt.in, configure.ac
=> shell script files in the various directories in boards/
=> host-tools/Makefile.in
=> the "bld.sh" shell script files in the directories in pkg-cfg/
=> shell script files in scripts/

These crosslinux build-tool makefiles and scripts are copyrighted by Douglas
Jerome, and any other people wherein noted, who wrote them.  These files are
licensed under the GPL Version 2 (June 1991), not version 2.2 or version 3.x or
any other version, unless explicitly otherwise stated.

        ==================================================

2. crosslinux build-tool configuration files

There are various configuration files used during a crosslinux build process;
these files are read by the make or bash programs (or any other programs so
used) under the programming direction of the various crosslinux build scripts.
These files are not considered to be "executable" as are the build scripts.

These files include, but are not limited to:

=> any file so used in the various directories in boards/
=> the "files" files in the various directories in pkg-cfg/
=> the Kconfig files in pkg-cfg/ and in the various directories in pkg-cfg/
=> crosslinux-config.sh, crosslinux-loader.txt, crosslinux-pkglst.txt

As any non-trivial thing written, these files are copyrighted.  They are
copyrighted by Douglas Jerome, and any other people wherein noted, who wrote
them.  These files are licensed under any "do whatever you want with" license
you can find or create; they are provided without any restriction.

        ==================================================

3. crosslinux run-time system scripts and configuration files

The crosslinux run-time system scripts and configuration files are part of a
delivered crosslinux-developed system; they are in the bootable CD-ROM image or
tar-file containing the bootable system.  These files reside in the crosslinux
build-tool directory structure; they are put into the run-time system during a
build process.

In the crosslinux build-tool directory structure, these files include, but are
not limited to:

=> any file so used in the various directories in /pkg-cfg/

NOTICE -> The various crosslinux run-time system scripts and configuration
          files used as described in this section that are in the various
          directories in:

          => pkg-cfg/syslinux*
          => pkg-cfg/u-boot*
          => pkg-cfg/yaboot*

          are intended to be changed as needed by crosslinux end-users and
          people making their own custom crosslinux builds.  Although, ANY
          CHANGES TO THESE FILES MAY RESULT IN A SYSTEM THAT WILL NOT BOOT,
          OR HAVE SOME OTHER UNDESIRABLE AFFECT and may not be supported, it is
          the nature of some of these files to be changed to reflect various
          users' needs.

          As any non-trivial thing written, these files are copyrighted.  They
          are copyrighted by Douglas Jerome, and any other people wherein

          These files are licensed under any "do whatever you want with"
          license you can find or create; they are provided without any
          restriction.

pkg-cfg/ Files
--------------

In several of the various directories in pkg-cfg/ there are files named
rootfs.tar.bz2; these each are a compressed tar-file that has one or more
files that will reside in a bootable crosslinux-developed system (this is
called the run-time system to distinguish it from the crosslinux build-tool).
In the run-time system these files are, but not limited to be:

=> configuration files in /etc/ and its subdirectories
=> (sys init scripts) shell scripts in /etc/rc.d/ and its subdirectories
=> /sbin/<name>-flash
=> /sbin/<name>-installer
=> /usr/bin/pacman
=> /usr/share/udhcpc/default.script

For the configuration files, see the NOTICE in this section above.

These crosslinux run-time scripts are copyrighted by Douglas Jerome, and any
other people wherein noted, who wrote them.  These files are licensed under the
GPL Version 2 (June 1991), not version 2.2 or version 3.x or any other version,
unless explicitly otherwise stated.
