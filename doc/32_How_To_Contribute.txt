32_How_To_Contribute.txt
========================

This short document describes how to report bugs, make requests and suggestions,
and otherwise how to help crosslinux.

Questions, Requests, and Suggestions:
------------------------------------

If you have some question(s) about using crosslinux, or some general crosslinux
question, then email the crosslinux mail list:  crosslinux@googlegroups.com

Build Problems:
--------------

DO NOT ASK me to pull from your git repo unless we have arranged to work
together on something.  Bug fixes should be given as one or more small patch in
the mail list, if at all feasible.

A crosslinux patch sent to the mail list must be small(ish) and specific; use
'diff -Naur', and have a short text header describing the patch and an SoB
"signed-off-by" line.  An SoB line is manually made in the patch header using
a text editor; it looks like:

     Signed-off-by: John DOE <john.doe@somewhere.net>

If you find a problem while using crosslinux, collect this information:
     -- crosslinux version number in the .version file, before you changed it
     -- (NOT OPTIONAL) problem statement: describe what is the symptom
     -- (option) proposed fix: describe what you think is the fix
     -- (option) software patch

Email this information to the crosslinux mail list:
     crosslinux@googlegroups.com
     http://groups.google.com/group/crosslinux/
